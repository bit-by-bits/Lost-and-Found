# FOR USERS

This project is developed by [myself](https://github.com/bit-by-bits) along with my friends, [Vaibhav](https://github.com/CoderVaibhavS) and [Apul](https://github.com/ranjanapul), under the flag of [IEEE BITS-Pilani](https://github.com/IEEE-BITS-Pilani-Student-Chapter). It provides a hassle-free experience to ease the complex process of searching for your precious belongings by providing a common platform for both stakeholders.

The tech stack used in this app was `React.js` (HTML/CSS/JS) and `Django Rest` (Python).

This website contains options to sign-in/sign-up by Email and GoogleAuth and to list the items you lost/found within the campus (with your contact) through an easy user interface.

# FOR DEVELOPERS

1. Clone the directory and run `npm install` to install the essential dependencies.

2. `npm start` will allow you to run the website in its development mode at [your localhost](http://localhost:3000). Check the errors using the console and browser as they keep reloading with changes.

3. After your changes, running `npm run build` would build the website for production in a BUILD folder. This bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

For other uses, you might refer to React Docs.
